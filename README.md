# silly-plot
Provides a real-time updateable graphing tool, with a few features for customising how it is displayed.

## Summary of the TODO list

1. Examples of how to use the main script.
2. Docs (with examples) for each of the customiseable display options.
3. Make the display options exportable so they can be reused.
4. Record the data so the visualisation can be recreated.
